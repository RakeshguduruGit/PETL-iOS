# Centered Titles Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ **BUILD STATUS: SUCCESSFUL**
All compilation errors have been resolved and the project builds successfully with no errors.

## üéØ **Overview**
Successfully implemented centered titles for both chart cards while preserving all original chart styling and visual elements.

## üîß **Key Changes Implemented**

### 1. **Centered Title Styling**
- **Charging History Title**: Added centered frame and multiline text alignment
- **Charging Power History Title**: Added centered frame and multiline text alignment
- **Preserved Font Style**: Kept `.font(.title3).bold()` styling intact
- **No Chart Changes**: All chart visuals, colors, and styling remain exactly as they were

### 2. **Implementation Details**
```swift
Text("Charging History")
    .font(.title3).bold()
    .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .center)
    .multilineTextAlignment(.center)

Text("Charging Power History")
    .font(.title3).bold()
    .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .center)
    .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
```

### 3. **Technical Approach**
- **Container-Only Changes**: Only modified the title Text elements
- **Frame Override**: Used `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .center)` to override VStack alignment
- **Multiline Support**: Added `.multilineTextAlignment(.center)` for proper text centering
- **No Chart Impact**: Charts continue to use their original styling and behavior

## üìÅ **Files Modified**

### `PETL/ContentView.swift`
- **Lines Modified**: Title Text elements for both chart cards
- **Changes**: Added centered frame and multiline text alignment modifiers
- **Preserved**: All chart styling, card structure, and functionality

## üé® **Visual Result**
- **Centered Titles**: Both "Charging History" and "Charging Power History" titles are now centered
- **Clean Layout**: Titles appear centered within their respective card containers
- **Consistent Styling**: Font weight and size remain identical to original design
- **Chart Preservation**: All chart visuals, colors, axes, and interactions remain unchanged

## ‚úÖ **Verification**
- **Build Success**: Project compiles without errors
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Minimal Impact**: Only title positioning affected, no chart modifications
- **Clean Implementation**: Simple, focused changes that achieve the desired result

## üöÄ **Ready for Testing**
The implementation is complete and ready for testing:
- Launch the app to see centered titles
- Verify charts maintain their original styling
- Confirm no visual regressions in chart appearance or functionality

The centered titles provide a cleaner, more balanced visual layout while maintaining all the sophisticated chart styling and functionality that was previously implemented.
