## Live Activity Guardrails (non-negotiable)
- All starts must call `LiveActivityManager.startActivity(reason:)` (wrapper).
- Seeded start is **private**; never call it directly.
- Exactly two `Activity.request` calls in LiveActivityManager.swift (push + fallback).
- Debounced unplug ends **by ID** via `endActive(...)`. Never call `endAll("local unplug")`.
- Foreground gate must be used. If not active â†’ defer start.
- `ðŸŽ¬ Started â€¦` logs use `addToAppLogsCritical` (push + no-push).
- See `docs/RELEASE_QA.md` before merging.

CI will block merges if these are violated (see `scripts/qa_gate.sh`).
