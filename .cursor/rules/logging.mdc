Log Philosophy & Audience - Who reads what logs and core principles
Logging Channels & Locations - Complete mapping of all log sources
Canonical Log Strings - Exact emoji + text for all 16 log types (alphabetical)
Life-Cycle Example Trace - Real cold-launch → plug → jiggle → unplug sequence
Log-Emission Rules - Unconditional vs DEBUG-only guidelines
Token & Session IDs - Debug token generation and session management
Adding New Log Lines - 5-step checklist + reserved emoji guide
Throttling & Noise Control - All current throttling mechanisms documented
Release-Build Differences - DEBUG compilation and TestFlight verification
Troubleshooting Guide - 6 common issues with causes and fixes
Contract Established:
Never remove unconditional logs - they're the diagnostic contract
Unique emojis prevent confusion - reserved prefix system documented
Session tokens enable tracing - debugToken appears in both console & Info tab
Throttling prevents spam - 30s snapshots, 60s pushes, 5s gate-busy limits
The specification serves as both documentation for current contributors and implementation guide for recreating the identical log stream in another codebase.Log Philosophy & Audience - Who reads what logs and core principles
